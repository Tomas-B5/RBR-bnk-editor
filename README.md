# RBR-bnk-editor
- Game: Richard Burns Rally
- Mod: https://rallysimfans.hu/
Script to generate custom banks. Very primitive

If you want to make your own custom bank file you would want to edit **bank_template.py** and run main.py hoping this spits out a modified "PC_Generic_1280.bnk", "template_labels.png" and "template.png files". First one goes to "RBR/Generic" folder other two are to be imported into GIMP or some other image editing software to be used as a template.
